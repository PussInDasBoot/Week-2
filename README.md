## Practice Debugging With RSpec

Debugging... Ahh, the life blood of developers. Okay let's get straight to work!

This gist contains individual exercises (one per file) for you to work through, in order. Fork and clone it and run through each file (in order) and fix the bugs in the code. 

For now, we are keeping both the logic code and the test code for each exercise in one file. This is for simplicity since the code is minimal. Normally though, rspec tests  would be in a separate file. 

To run a particular exercise, run the file using the `rspec` command. Example:

    rspec 1_hello_world.rb

**Important Note:** Don't attempt to modify/fix the test (Rspec) code. The bugs in these challenges are always in the logic code, not the test code. Consider the test code documentation for defining how the logic code is expected to behave.
